# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** The calculator must correctly evaluate mathematical expressions — from simple arithmetic to scientific functions — and display results clearly.
**Current focus:** Phase 7: Visual Design System

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 11 (Visual Design System)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — Roadmap created for v1.1 milestone

Progress: [██████░░░░] 55% (13/24 total plans completed)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13 (v1.0 only)
- Average duration: ~5 min
- Total execution time: ~1 hour

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Expression Input | 3 | ~15 min | ~5 min |
| 2. Scientific Functions | 3 | ~15 min | ~5 min |
| 3. Scientific Panel | 1 | ~5 min | ~5 min |
| 4. Graphing Core | 2 | ~10 min | ~5 min |
| 5. Graphing Interactions | 2 | ~10 min | ~5 min |
| 6. UX Polish | 2 | ~10 min | ~5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans (v1.0): Stable velocity (~5 min/plan)
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after v1.0 completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0: Toggle panel for scientific buttons — responsive slide-out works well (informs v1.1 mode toggle)
- v1.0: Inline graph panel — graph stays in context (now evolving to full-screen integration)
- v1.0: Canvas API for graphing — full control, smooth rendering (continues in v1.1)
- v1.1: Visual redesign comes first — establishes foundation for all new UI components

### Pending Todos
